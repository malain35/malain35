# About

I am a research engineer working in computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning. I am currently working with <a href="https://tyndallfx.com/index.php/about-us/">Tyndall FX</a> on NeRFs and 3D gaussian splatting products.
This github page lists repositories related to my work on light field while I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://v-sense.scss.tcd.ie/">V-SENSE project</a> in Trinity College Dublin.
